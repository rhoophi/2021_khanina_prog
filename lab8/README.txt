hi! glad you've opened this game because I've written it with tears

here are the RULES:
there are two players who play together against enemies, bombs and targets: player A is navy colored ball, player B is
pink colored ball.

player A can move and shoot by pushing the WASD keys and clicking the left mouse button

player B can move and shoot by pushing the arrow keys and clicking the right mouse button

both A and B aim by moving the cursor, which could be complicated... but I left you the right to decide who is going to
use the mouse!

also remember that guns have capacity, so you can't use an infinite number of pistons in a period of time

enemies can destroy players instantly if they move slowly or deprive player's health points noticeably, also they are
undestroyable. bombs take 1 healthpoint each time player hits it and respawns. if player's healthpoints go 0, game ends.

you have 90 seconds to earn as many points, as you can.
