hi! glad you've opened this game because I've written it with tears

here are the RULES:
there are two players who play together against enemies, bombs and targets: player A is navy colored ball, player B is
pink colored ball.

player A can move and shoot by pushing the WASD keys and clicking the left mouse button

player B can move and shoot by pushing the arrow keys and clicking the right mouse button

both A and B aim by moving the cursor, which could be complicated... but I left you the right to decide who is going to
use the mouse!

also remember that guns have capacity, so you can't use an infinite number of pistons in a period of time

enemies can destroy players instantly if they move slowly or deprive player's health points noticeably. they are
destroyable: you just need to hit it with piston. bombs take 1 healthpoint each time player hits it and respawns.
if player's healthpoints go 0, game ends.

if players shoot each other, game ends.

you have 90 seconds to earn as many points, as you can.
